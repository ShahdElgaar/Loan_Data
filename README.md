**Loan Data**

This project analyzes a loan application dataset using Python and machine learning.
It focuses on cleaning real-world financial data, exploring key applicant attributes, and building classification models to predict loan approval outcomes.

The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with supervised learning to understand which factors influence loan approval decisions and how well different models perform.

**Key Insights**

-Loan approval rates vary noticeably across different education levels.

-Approved applicants tend to have higher and less skewed annual incomes.

-Age and credit score show a positive correlation, indicating improved credit behavior with age.

-Monthly income distribution is right-skewed, with mean income higher than the median.

-Random Forest outperforms a single Decision Tree by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

**Modeling Approach**

-Cleaned and standardized numeric and categorical features.

-Encoded binary and categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

-Applied one-hot encoding to multi-category features.

**Trained and evaluated:**

-Decision Tree Classifier 

-Random Forest Classifier 

-Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrices.

-Compared training and testing performance to assess overfitting.
